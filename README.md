# Mlamuli Biyela | Peacemaker Dev — Portfolio Website

## Overview
This repository holds the complete source for the personal portfolio site of Mlamuli Biyela (Peacemaker Dev). The site presents a professional student and freelance profile, showcasing projects, services, skills, and contact options. Several linked projects are hosted as separate GitHub Pages demos.

## Key Files & Their Purpose

- **index.html** — Main landing page: hero, intro, skills, services, and calls-to-action.
- **work.html** — Projects showcase: project cards with screenshots, links, and case-study templates.
- **about.html** — Extended biography and background information.
- **contact.html** — Contact form and business/social links.
- **mystyles.css** — Central stylesheet that controls layout, theme, and responsive behavior.
- **images/** — All image assets used across the site (profile photos, project thumbnails, logo, backgrounds).
- **other project links** — Several projects linked from `work.html` are separate repositories and GitHub Pages sites (see Features).
